        The hazards of not hiring a professional programmer

      <div class="accordion-body">Choosing not to hire a professional programmer can lead to poorly written code, security vulnerabilities, and unstable systems that cost far more to fix later. Inexperienced development often results in frequent bugs, slow performance, and software that cannot scale as your business grows. These issues can cause downtime, data loss, and damage to your company’s reputation. What may seem like a short-term savings can quickly turn into long-term expenses, missed opportunities, and frustrated customers.
